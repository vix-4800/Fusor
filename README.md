## Quick Start

1. Ensure **Python 3.10 or newer** is installed.

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python -m fusor
```

Set the `APP_NAME` environment variable to customize the window title:

```bash
APP_NAME="My App" python -m fusor
```

## üê≥ Docker Mode

Enable the **Use Docker** option in the Settings tab to run commands inside your project's Docker containers.

-   Set **PHP Service** to match the container name in your `docker-compose.yml`
-   Support for multiple Compose files (separated by `;`)
-   Optional Compose profile via **Compose Profile** field
-   The **Docker** tab will appear automatically

Start/Stop buttons execute `docker compose up -d` and `docker compose down` (with `--profile` if specified) accordingly.

---

## Testing

Install the development dependencies and run the test suite:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest -q
```

PyQt6 and pytest-qt are required for running the tests. Headless testing is supported by setting `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`, already handled in the GitHub Actions workflow.
